   <h1>To the Movies</h1>
    <section class="bcopy"><p>Hannah smoothed her skirt as she walked along the street. The streetlights lit her way, glowing pools of light giving her courage on this dark and cold night. Snow covered the grass and trees, giving everything a bit of a glow in the darkness. </p>
    <p>Looking around, she made sure that she hadn’t been noticed yet. Her mother didn’t know she was out, and would probably have a litter of kittens when she did discover her missing. Or at least she hoped that they wouldn’t notice at all. But things happened, and she just hoped if they discovered her absence it would be after the movie was over. </p>
    <p>Picking up her pace she made it to the theater. She clutched her purse to her as she stepped up to the ticket seller. “One ticket please.” Her voice wavered with excitement as the ticket was handed to her. This was going to be her first movie. </p>
    <p>Hannah’s mother said that only those who lacked religion saw movies, but Hannah had always wanted to see a proper movie. All the girls at school said that the silent movies were great, especially those with Charlie Chaplin in them. He was constantly being imitated. </p>
    <p>However, she was never able to put her two cents in. Considering she had never seen any of his movies. But tonight she would. The theater was showing two of his movies tonight, and she would see both of them. </p>
    <p>Stepping into the theater, eyes sparkling, Hannah’s eyes widened as she looked around curiously. She had never seen seats like these. They looked so cushy, and absolutely lounge-able. Taking a seat in the back, Hannah bounced impatiently. The movie needed to begin; she would finally be able to talk with her friends about it.</p>
    <p>The theater darkened, and she could hear the thrum of the projector behind her. Light shot towards the screen and a picture became clear.</p>
    <p>Hannah was riveted as she watched. She was a little disappointed that they weren’t actually talking, but the music was amazing and the picture was even more breathtaking. She laughed with the audience, and gasped with them two when Charlie did something a bit more unexpected than usual. </p>
    <p>As the movies came to a close, Hannah could feel her heart beating. It hurt a little bit, seeing the movies end. Like the magical ending was taken from her. The magic that the dimmed room had placed her under lifted from her shoulders. She wanted to stay, to experience more. </p>
    <p>The movies had drawn her in, they called to her. Wanting her to join them…and oh Hannah did. She wanted to join them. Be in the movie with Charlie Chaplin. Make people laugh and cry, and gasp in surprise. She wanted to be that person. Oh the glamour of movie stardom.</p>
    <p>Her heart was set; she would never have a goal that she wanted more than this. Oh her mother would fight her, but Hannah knew something her mother didn’t. </p>
    <p>She had fallen in love with the movies, and nothing would stand between them ever again. Hannah closed her eyes briefly, wishing upon the Christmas spirit around her to help her to her goal. She could feel her heart beating faster as hope swelled within, she would make her goal of joining the movies. </p>

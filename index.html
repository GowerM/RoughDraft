 <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Mollie Gower, and I am currently finishing up my final year at Eastern Washington University and double majoring in Creative Writing and Visual Communication Design. I am the chief copy editor at The Easterner, and am part of the EWU Fencing Club and EWU Chinese Conversation Group. My goal for next two or three years is to teach English in China, then either go into a publishing master program or start as an entry level editor at a publishing company. My dream job is being an acquisitions editor or a translator, or if both of those fall through an astronaught.

My writing samples include, essays, short fiction and articles that I have written, while the design portion gives examples of various school and personal projects. The editing section is devoted to the viewer and has a form that one can fill out to request my services, which I will gladly do with gusto.</p>

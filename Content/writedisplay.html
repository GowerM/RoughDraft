    <h1>Poe, Guilt, and Mental Illness</h1>
    <p>Edgar Allan Poe teeters on the brink of extremes between death and the mental psyche of his characters in his poems and short stories. Poe uses symbolism, like the vultures eye in “The Tell-Tale Heart,” to signify death and the extremes people will sometimes go to avoid or come to terms with death. His poems, like “Annabel Lee” and “The Raven,” explore the effects of losing a loved one and the grief process, while “The Fall of the House of Usher,” and “The Tell-Tale Heart” explores the maddening effect death has when it is looming towards a person. The acts committed by characters in some of Poe’s works are in definite relation to the looming shadow that death casts upon us all. Poe easily illustrates the extremes some people will go to either reconcile with death or ward death off.</p>
<p>The death of a loved one is always hard, especially for a man who considers the now dead woman to have been his soul mate, or something just as close. In “Annabel Lee,” Poe tells the ending of a romance between the narrator and Annabel Lee, and his grief driven decision to stay by her side, committing a slow and possibly painful suicide in the process. The narrator’s extreme grief is driven by the love he had for Annabel Lee, before she was taken from him and transported to the next life.</p> 
<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we –
Of many far wiser than we –
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea, 
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee: (643)</p>
<p>The narrator makes the claim that his and Annabel Lee’s soul are connected, very reminiscent of soul mates. Soul mates, a belief that there are pairs of people who together make up one soul, gives reason to why the narrator is so grief stricken, especially with how Annabel Lee died. A quick and sudden death would be very traumatic and not allow for quick closure. “A wind came out of the cloud by night, / Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.” (643) A wind coming from a cloud is rather sudden, since one does not see the wind, suggesting that the death was sudden. Such a death would take a toll on the claimed unity of souls between the narrator and Annabel Lee. As a result, the extremes the narrator performs of staying by her sepulcher and committing slow suicide is reasonable, if not a little insane. However, while he is there he starts to see Annabel Lee in everything. </p>
<p>For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams 
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; 
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee: (644) </p>
<p>The narrator cannot get over his grief if he is constantly thinking of his Annabel Lee, and it will be detrimental to his health if he continues to stay by her side. The sudden death, the constant reminders are all factors that contribute to his decision to stay by her side, ultimately seeling his own death.</p> 
<p>And so, all the night tide, I lie down by the side 
Of my darling – my darling – my life and my bride, 
In her sepulchre there by the sea – 
In her tomb by the sounding sea. (644)</p> 
<p>Of course, his lying by her sepulcher, or place of burial, could cause his own death. Lying outside, waiting, waiting for his love either to come to him or he to go to her. This almost suicidal thinking is a rather extreme, grief-driven decision. It is one thing to grieve, another to perpetually be by the burial site allowing the feeling of his love to look down upon him. It is a tragic almost death, because the narrator is not going to commit a fast suicide, but a long and slow one. The narrator’s grief is leading him to madness, and he is doing nothing to stop it. </p> 
	<p>The death of a woman takes its toll on everyone, especially on those who loved her most dear. The grief born from the death of someone that is loved can take many forms, but in “The Raven” the narrator is looking for answers. However his grief, answer-seeking madness drives towards the answers he wants to hear, not the ones he knows are true. Instead of laying next to sepulcher of his love, he thinks on her in the comfort of a roof over his head. “And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. / Eagerly I wished the morrow; – vainly I had tried to borrow / From my books surcease of sorrow – sorrow for the lost Lenore –“ (638). The narrator here, as is the one in “Annabel Lee,” is also dwelling on his sorrow from losing Lenore when he hears something at his door. It is natural for buildings to creak and give the illusion of someone at a door and the narrator wonders if there might actually be someone out there. He peers into the darkness around him, listening for sounds of a stranger that has come to speak with him possibly giving him relief from the grief that grips him so. When the silence is broken and he hears a single word. “And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ‘Lenore!’ / This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ‘Lenore!’”(638). He answers the darkness with the name the darkness gave him, and the narrator gains hope as a tapping comes upon his window. He thinks that it might be his Lenore come back to give him relief for her passing, or even her come back to stay with him. Unlatching the window he is greeted by a raven hopping into the room. As the raven comes into the room he “[p]erched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door –“ (638), which gives evidence that Poe is using the raven for not only its death symbolism that has popped up in modern times but also its wisdom and role as a messenger. Ravens, in many ancient cultures, are thought of as wise oracles that whisper secrets to those they serve. The narrator originally picks up on the wisdom as he starts to question the raven hoping to get word of his Lenore, anything to relieve his grief, but only gets the single answer of “nevermore.” He wants an answer so badly that he tries to put words in the raven’s beak. “Respite – respite and Nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore! / Let me quaff this kind Nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!’ / Quoth the raven, ‘Nevermore’”(639). The narrator obviously wants respite for his grief and he begs this creature for the answer, yet he will not get one, at least nothing more than “nevermore.” The narrator, rather than the narrator of “Annabel Lee,” wants an answer to how he shall live on without his Lenore. He needs it so desperately that he is trying to put meaning to the single word uttered by the raven.</p> 
<p>And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
						    Shall be lifted – nevermore! (640)</p>
<p>The narrator finally realizes that he will never be able to rise above the grief that grips his soul. He will forever see the “pallid bust” of Lenore and he will never be rid of the image. The raven has not done much, except repeat a single word and sit upon his Greek patron. The narrator has put the words in the beak of the raven, grown angry, and finally accepted that he will never be rid of the grief that Lenore has left him with. This narrator’s madness is not as strong as the narrator’s of “Annabel Lee,” but the narrator of “The Raven” will forever be haunted and weighed down by the death of Lenore.</p> 
<p>The paranoia of death looming just around the corner is amplified in “The Tell-Tale Heart” as the narrator tries to come to terms with the old man’s vulture eye. The narrator’s paranoia, extreme suspicion of something that has not caused him harm, starts with the eye of his employer and allows for the extreme decision to kill the old man. The narrator has a stable madness – cleaning up the blood, hiding the body – while committing the act of removing the symbol of death from his sight, but soon spirals out of control upon the living officers coming and trod upon the remains of his disposed death. “The disease had sharpened my senses – not destroyed – not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute.”(691) The narrator recognizes that he has a disease, his paranoia, but he also recognizes that it has strengthened his senses, which unfortunately drives him to give up the game. This paranoia also makes him hyperaware of the old man’s eye, and drives death symbolism for the eye deep into his psyche. He had reason enough to off the old man, the old man’s eye reminded him of a vulture. A scavenger of death, an omen of what is to come for him. “He had the eye of a vulture – a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees – very gradually – I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.” (691). The eye is later referred to as the “evil eye” but it is evident that the narrator links the eye to that of death. This leads us to realize that the narrator has a fear of dying, yet he is all right with killing to get rid of that reminder. “All in vain; because death, in approaching the old man, had stalked with his black shadow before him, and the shadow had now reached and enveloped the victim.” (693) The narrator is obsessed with death, he describes the old man slightly waking up at the feeling of death looming over him, but it is not enough to save him. The narrator quickly and efficiently cleans up his kill, however the police are there to investigate a noise complaint from a neighbor. At the time, the narrator is calm, easily talking to the cops. Secure in the knowledge that he had removed death from his sight. This narrator however starts to hear a noise that slowly builds as he talks with the police over where he buried the old man. “The ringing became more distinct: I talked more freely, to get rid of the feeling; but it continued and gained definitiveness – until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.” (694) The narrator tries to hide the noise that only he can hear; yet he cannot hide it. His paranoia starts to come in as the realization that he has not gotten rid of the death omen starts to build. He did not mean the old man harm, just the eye. The eye that reminded him that death is looming. His paranoia driven hallucination makes him hear a heart beat under the floorboards, and finally he cannot take it anymore. “’Villians!’ I shrieked, ‘dissemble no more! I admit the deed! – tear up the planks! – here, here! – it is the beating of his hideous heart!’”(695) The narrator’s psyche cannot take the clashing of life and death in one room, especially with the death omen still under his feet. He realizes that he cannot run from death, but he still cannot deal with that and instead has a break in his mental stability. In contrast to “Annabel Lee” and “The Raven” the narrator does not have the grief that those narrators had. Instead he started with paranoia of death watching him, amplifying his senses to the point of hearing things. The narrator would have gotten away with it if he had not had the overwhelming madness that was brought on with the thought of death.</p> 
<p>Roderick Usher is allowed to watch the death and rebirth of his sister, Madeline, every time she has an episode of cataleptical. Instead of the narrator going mad because of death, “The Fall of the House of Usher” gives the reader an outside look at Roderick Usher as his sister haunts him. Madeline has a condition of “partially cataleptical,” which left her looking like she has passed away and is reborn every time she comes out of it. This type of illness would be very trying on Roderick and Madeline alike, though we only get the end of Roderick’s fall into instability. “[B]ut he had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far more than ordinary wanness had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears.” (658) Roderick gets an entire person as his symbol of death, unlike the eye in “The Tell-Tale Heart,” with Madeline perpetually falling to death and rising again, it is no wonder that Roderick has dangerous thoughts. It is no wonder that at her latest episode he buried her alive in the basement, lid sealed to keep her from rising again. Though he did not have to seal her coffin, but as his mind deteriorates it gives to reason that he would seal the coffin so as to keep his sister from rising again and haunting him. The narrator tries to relieve Roderick of his gloom, thinking that Madeline is actually dead. However, we start to get a clue of how Roderick sees his sister, she is a symbol of death. She is perpetually dying and coming back to life, an endless cycle. “I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions.” (663) Roderick obviously wants to believe that his sister is dead. His hyperaware senses tell him otherwise, but he stays silent, hoping that it is madness that creeps upon him and that Madeline is finally resting in peace. He can hear her scratching and her heart beating, but he dare not speak of it. He does not want to confront that omen of death creeping upon him. </p>
<p>“Not hear it? –yes, I hear it, and have heard it. Long –long–long–many minutes, many hours, many days, have I hear it–yet I dared not –I dared not speak! We have put her living in the tomb! Said I not that my senses were acute? –I now tell them – many, many days ago – yet I dared not – I dared not speak! And now – to-night– Ethelred – ha! ha! – the breaking of the hermit’s door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of the shield –say, rather, the rending of the coffin, and the grating of the iron hinges, and her struggles within the coppered archway of the vault! Oh whither shall I fly? Will she not be here anon? Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste? Have I not heard her footsteps on the stair? Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart? Madman!” – here he sprung violently to his feet, and shrieked out his syllables as if in the effort he were giving up his soul – “Madman! I tell you that she now stands without the door!” (666)
 Roderick has a definite fear of death that has led him to the rash decision of burying his sister alive, yet he can hear her living, beating heart. He knows she is still alive, but does not want her to be. He wants to break the cycle his sister is in, not the in-between state that she is forced to stay in. Roderick cannot stand seeing his sister die over and over, yet he cannot stand seeing her come back to life. Roderick like the narrators of “Annabel Lee” and “The Raven” had a woman’s death bring him to madness, and like “The Tell-Tale Heart” he heard her still beating heart, punishing him for leaving her behind. </p>
<p>The looming shadow of death drives many to rash decisions. Poe’s characters are driven to extremes to either avoid death or come to terms with death. “Annabel Lee” and “The Raven” dealt in the decisions of being left behind by the women they loved, while “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Fall of the House of Usher” dealt with the overwhelming weight that death has on the living. These characters were ultimately driven to their decisions by death and through death they tried justify their decisions.

    <h1>Plague</h1>
    <p>
    The pedestrian warning blinked red. A woman in thin heels tugged her baggy clothed boyfriend in the protective rails of white. A now-extinct bird chirped a warning, informing the few blind in the neighborhood that the light was going to change. Beaten down cars rusted at the side of the roads, sellers and shopkeepers tried to charm their way into the wallets of potential customers. The degrading buildings had garbage decorating their feet, bags hiding the potential memories of those who dropped them carelessly. Ragged gentlemen and ladies held signs between the open market stalls, hoping for a kindness from some of their better off brethren. Old women tugged their impatient grandchildren from stall to stall, looking for decent clothes for their children. Produce wilted in the windows of grimy grocers, as mothers stormed through the aisles with whimpering children. The grime of the neighborhood seemed to grip not only the living, but the buildings and plant-life alike. Crawling up the buildings like watery ivy, grasping onto all those who passed. Pedestrians stepped easily around the grime, having years of living with it to know where to step, like a younger sibling asking for the same things for the hundredth time.  
    </p>
    <p>As a newly extinct bird sang the go-ahead, a girl with an unwavering smile stepped into the protective rails. Earphones dangled from her ears, as grocery bags swung-controllably from her hands. A small berth was given to the unwavering smile to allow her passage. Something about he unsettled those who came in close contact with the unwavering smile. She unnerved them all, it might have been her un-breaking smile or the fact she lived on the top floor of one of the most decrepit buildings in a room surrounded by books. The rumors were abounding about the girl from the regulars of the street. She had a glint in her crinkled eyes, one that twinkled a bit too much, she lived alone and did not fear anyone trying to get at her, and overall she was just too nice. They knew of her, the interest that the pimp showed in the unwavering smile, though the pimp did not try to recruit her. The unfortunates of the human hemisphere were the only ones who did not fear her, she was kind to them, giving them amateur medical attention, food, advice, and all with an unwavering smile. She did not see them as unfortunates, with her dazed distracted eyes, she saw potential and good in most of them. There were the few that unwavering smile would avoid, but she would always keep her smile. </p>
    <p>She wandered through the streets, easily side-stepping the non-regular shoppers, keeping out of everyone’s way until she reached her building. Climbing the stairs littered with refuse and playing children, she climbed higher and higher until she reached the top floor. Whispers followed her as she climbed, children giggling about the stories they told, she was a princess lost in time, she was waiting for some miracle to take her away, or their favorite, she was an alien and she was trying to phone home. The children were always nice to her, not recognizing the smile for the buffer that they she knew it was. If she was always smiling, she couldn’t be feeling bad feelings, feelings of hurt that always hurt others much worse. Her kryptonite would forever be the negative feelings that plagued her dreams, but she was able to ward off the negative by forever being positive. The homeless, which she referred to as ladies and gentlemen for their kindness and not being completely aware of everything that goes on around her, were the nicest to her. In part because the homeless knew that she would not turn them away if they needed food, sometimes making herself go hungry for the night. The ladies only humored her because the pimp took an interest in the unwavering smile. The pimp never made propositions to the unwavering smile to join her ladies, but she did request the girl provide basic medical attention, using the medical skills that she learned from her brief years at university. The ladies tolerate the unwavering smile, finding her mumblings to herself a little unnerving. They would whisper amongst themselves wondering if there was something wrong with her, she seemed stable, as long as the smile never wavered.  </p>
    <p>The silence of her floor was boxed in by the noise of the outside, she loved the silence and the drifting noise, wishing that was what went on inside her head, the noise being kept outside. Cars driving, people yelling, children laughing, sellers charming, drifted through the windows and over stairs, but they never became part of the top floor, hindered by the installation of a trap door, littered with books, nonperishable food items, chords and electrical equipment, and the sightless dolls, always watching and waiting. Waiting for the unwavering smile to break so they can come to her rescue. They took pity on the girl, watching her as she tore herself apart with guilt, trying to find the answer to why she was there. Taking the earphones out she placed her cans and boxes of food among the stacks of books that ranged from medical anomalies to occult texts that would hopefully explain the ball of writhing chaos wedged between her stomach and liver. Lounging in the room was the pimp, long black hair draped over a single shoulder as she flipped nonchalantly through one of the various books, her sheer red cocktail dress pooled around her legs, her lips matching the dress. The pimp was just as flashy as her male counterparts, but she was much better organized, earlier that day she had taken over a street from one of those counterparts, he wasn’t no where near happy about it, but he couldn’t do anything. The pimp had a much more extensive network than he could contend with, if he wanted to take her down, he would have to infiltrate her network. For that he would need resources that he did not have access to. Unwavering smile placed her bag on the floor and lifted some books out of a crumbling chair, Someone need medical attention, No, just wanted to talk, Huh, They’re closing in on you, I know, I saw them on the street, Did they follow you, No, I lost them on 3rd street, Well you know what they say about fleeing girls, What, You will need to be able to run in heels to track them down. Unwavering smile laughed, the pimp chuckling along, closing the book she asked, What will you do when they find you, They won’t, they’ve been looking for weeks and haven’t gotten any closer, They will find you, especially when you make food run, I’ll just have to be more careful, I could send my employees to get your food, They’ll mess it up, No they won’t, they wouldn’t dare, They would try and blame it on not understanding the list, They wouldn’t dare. The pimp continued to mutter they wouldn’t dare over and over as she analyzed her girls, she may have to cut a few loose if they were really that untrustworthy. </p>
    <p>Unwavering grabbed the nearest book off the floor, flipping through it she starts from the chapter of Haemolacria, she had not caused anyone to cry tears of blood, but maybe it would give some answers as to why the voices were those of comatose patients that she either knew or met briefly. The girls are beginning to whisper, Someone is always whispering, Agents have been coming and asking questions about a woman that matches your description, It always matches my description, It always does, doesn’t it. The unwavering smile looked up, making sure that the pimp had not heard the slimy voice, it gave her chills, the voice of her almost-rapist forever in her mind, she was trying to be rid of the menace but her books were not forthcoming with the information that she needed. The pimp noticed her stiffening, knowing that it was those voices that only belonged to real people for the unwavering smile, the aftereffects of her existence staining the lives of those who had been too close when her smile wavered, reaching behind her back, the pimp pulled a box from behind and placed it before her, I brought you a present, a thank you for not stealing my employees voices, I would never do that, Still, if you weren’t in control they would be lost to me and limp bodies aren’t what the customers ordered, What will I do with a dog, They’re sad to be therapeutic, it will help, Are you sure. The pimp paused, trying to see if the unwavering smile was indeed talking to her, Yes, I’m sure. Standing she brushed off her skirt, walking through the piles of books she kissed the top of her head, Take care of yourself, I will try to lead them astray. The unwavering smile watched her leave, the pimp was worried about the smile those voices were becoming too real. </p>
    <p>The pimp did not like it, she did not believe that the voices matched any living person, the unwavering smile could only provide one or two names, the others would not give her a name, or so they claimed. When the pimp made it to the bottom of the stairs, she nodded to the men she had stationed there. They were her insurance, there were various groups that were interested in the girl upstairs, and who was she to give up a potential prize that could reward her with vast amounts of money. The rumors she heard were that of this girl stealing the voices of those who threatened her, though she did not have the control to not harm those who were within a half-mile radius. She had only heard reports, never seen it in happen though. She really wanted to see it happen, the rumors had to be false. She needed to make a tip. </p>
    <p>Upstairs, the unwavering smile had tentively moved to the box, she opened it to see a growing great dane within the box. The smile grew bigger as she saw the potential in the puppy, the paws, head and ears were too big, alluding to the progress that would happen over the course of a few weeks. You don’t deserve anything, I’m trying, she answered the slimy voice. Her mind was packed with the voices, those of her attackers, those of innocent pedestrians, and those of friends. She had not done anything to her family, they were not within the half-mile radius when she had felt threatened, but others were. Some had weak voices and were easily pushed to the side by the stronger voices, those of her friends and attackers, but her friends had been getting weaker and weaker, she was running out of time. Maybe this puppy would give her the answer she was looking for. Picking up the wiggling mass of energy, the unwavering smile cleared a corner of books and tried to communicate that this was where he could do his business, the puppy just licked her face in answer. The puppy would forget where the corner was and destroy a discarded book later that night, and the unwavering smile would have to lead the puppy back to the oasis of waste. </p>
    <p>Pulling out some spam, the unwavering smile tried to recollect what information she had gathered so far. Not much, said the tired voice of her almost-forgotten friend, we don’t know much, I know, I will keep looking, I promise to heal you, You never promise me, the slimy voice said, Or me, said the gravely voice of her almost mugger, You never promise us that you will return us, But you are bad, I don’t want to release you on the world, only the good, I want to put the innocents back, How do you know that they are innocent, you don’t know them, the slimy voice was drowning out the other voices, But they have to be, I need to keep the bad in like some box, keeping the bad in while allowing the good to stay outside, You’ll never win. The bickering continued, but the unwavering smile refused to listen to the rest of their bickering as she continued to go through the stolen books. She had acquired all the books from libraries and archives, she needed to study them, and it wasn’t safe for her to be in crowded places. It wasn’t safe for her to stay here, but she had not had an episode in over three years, she hadn’t talked to anyone from back home in over five years, but she kept track of the coma patients. Those that she had forced into the hospital, she repented every time she read the articles. The puppy laid its head on her leg, she absently rubbed her hand over his head as she offered some spam with the other hand. Flipping through the occult book, the unwavering smile lost herself in the research, searching for an answer to her predicament, her plague upon humanity. </p>
    <p>The pimp had searched and found one of the men that had tried to follow the unwavering smile, however she was not expecting to be manhandled for the information. A woman in her position was not to be mishandled, these men knew not of whom they were messing with, but she smiled and bared it. She gave directions to where they would find the woman they were looking for, and they manhandled her once again, forcing her to follow them. To see her betrayal unfold in front of her, the pimp’s smile wavered. </p>
    <p>The unwavering smile stirred from her curled position as a wet nose made its presence known in her ear. Fluttering her hand passed her ear, looking up she noticed the strong smell of urine and saw that one of the discarded books soaked through. She did not shed a tear as the book had already been ruled out as a potential to being a possible answer. She did not want possible answers she wanted true answers. The puppy’s head tilted as the oversized ears heard something from down below, alerting the unwavering smile to what was missing, the drifting noise, there were no cars, there were no people talking loudly, no slow sirens, there was nothing. Scrambling towards the trap door in the floor, the unwavering lifted it up a little to listen to those below, she was suddenly bombarded with screams as the sound of books dropping silenced them one by one. The unwavering smile realized that those looking for her also wanted to remove any trace of her, they had never been this close before, she usually slipped away before they could close their hands upon her throat. The puppy began to yip as his sensitive ears picked up the low pops of death. Allowing the door to drop, the unwavering smile started to scramble for her stuff, she felt her smile falling and she needed to get away. Packing up what food she could along with the money she had begged off others, she picked up the puppy and started for the fire escape. The stolen books would be returned and she would just have to start over again, but she was too late. </p>
    <p>The trap door burst up as bright light blinded the unwavering smile from the fire escape, yells of show us your hands, get on the floor were screamed from the men in masks. Lowering the puppy carefully, the unwavering smile sank to her knees. She was forcing her smile now. It fell a fraction as she noticed a flash of red, I thought we were friends. She did not get an answer as the pimp smile nervously. She was roughly searched, and pushed around, her smile was fighting to be a frown, the bundle of chaos straining to be free of its confines. She clamped down on it, these people did not deserve that fate, they were only following orders. As they finished up, they forced her to stand. They started to lead her away, the puppy whimpering in the corner. She looked back briefly and noticed her earphones sitting forgotten on the chair, getting free of the grasping hands she reached for her earphones. She would be much happier with the earphones and no one would be hurt. The angry men did not see that, and one brought the butt of his gun down hard upon the back of her head, it was enough to release the chaos. The screams now filled the quiet space as their voices were ripped from them, funneling into the already full head. The pimp watched, mesmerized as her drive was stolen and inserted into the girl. She was sad that she was wrong, but fascinated by this plague upon the earth. </p>
    <p>It took the girl five minutes to recover. Opening her eyes, she looked at all the limp bodies, adjusting them into more comfortable positions. She started to pack up more slowly as she prepared to leave. She would call 911 after she left, no use sticking around. Fixing a makeshift leash, she attached it to the puppy that was still whimpering in the corner. The girl was happy to know that animals were spared from the onslaught that was her chaos. Patting him on the head, she led him down the stairs. </p>
    <p>Stopping at the entrance that led outside, she fixed her smile and stepped into the swallowing night. </p>

    <h1>To the Movies</h1>
    <p>Hannah smoothed her skirt as she walked along the street. The streetlights lit her way, glowing pools of light giving her courage on this dark and cold night. Snow covered the grass and trees, giving everything a bit of a glow in the darkness. </p>
    <p>Looking around, she made sure that she hadn’t been noticed yet. Her mother didn’t know she was out, and would probably have a litter of kittens when she did discover her missing. Or at least she hoped that they wouldn’t notice at all. But things happened, and she just hoped if they discovered her absence it would be after the movie was over. </p>
    <p>Picking up her pace she made it to the theater. She clutched her purse to her as she stepped up to the ticket seller. “One ticket please.” Her voice wavered with excitement as the ticket was handed to her. This was going to be her first movie. </p>
    <p>Hannah’s mother said that only those who lacked religion saw movies, but Hannah had always wanted to see a proper movie. All the girls at school said that the silent movies were great, especially those with Charlie Chaplin in them. He was constantly being imitated. </p>
    <p>However, she was never able to put her two cents in. Considering she had never seen any of his movies. But tonight she would. The theater was showing two of his movies tonight, and she would see both of them. </p>
    <p>Stepping into the theater, eyes sparkling, Hannah’s eyes widened as she looked around curiously. She had never seen seats like these. They looked so cushy, and absolutely lounge-able. Taking a seat in the back, Hannah bounced impatiently. The movie needed to begin; she would finally be able to talk with her friends about it.</p>
    <p>The theater darkened, and she could hear the thrum of the projector behind her. Light shot towards the screen and a picture became clear.</p>
    <p>Hannah was riveted as she watched. She was a little disappointed that they weren’t actually talking, but the music was amazing and the picture was even more breathtaking. She laughed with the audience, and gasped with them two when Charlie did something a bit more unexpected than usual. </p>
    <p>As the movies came to a close, Hannah could feel her heart beating. It hurt a little bit, seeing the movies end. Like the magical ending was taken from her. The magic that the dimmed room had placed her under lifted from her shoulders. She wanted to stay, to experience more. </p>
    <p>The movies had drawn her in, they called to her. Wanting her to join them…and oh Hannah did. She wanted to join them. Be in the movie with Charlie Chaplin. Make people laugh and cry, and gasp in surprise. She wanted to be that person. Oh the glamour of movie stardom.</p>
    <p>Her heart was set; she would never have a goal that she wanted more than this. Oh her mother would fight her, but Hannah knew something her mother didn’t. </p>
    <p>She had fallen in love with the movies, and nothing would stand between them ever again. Hannah closed her eyes briefly, wishing upon the Christmas spirit around her to help her to her goal. She could feel her heart beating faster as hope swelled within, she would make her goal of joining the movies. </p>

    <h1>Of Love and Giraffes</h1>
    <p>Leo stood by his favorite tree, long purple tongue grasping at the leaves that clung to the high branches. His eyes swiveled between the tree and the window. This was the reason why he loved this tree so much, he could gaze at the pinpricks of light that shown through the darkness. The darkness that surrounded the ship he called home</p>
    <p>Space was certainly a wonderful place. So vast and possibilities. The humans hadn’t believed the giraffes, which had declared themselves fit for space. Calling them dumb animals, animals who were unable to function a simple lever. But they had proved the humans wrong. </p>
    <p>Now the giraffe race was more numerous and scattered than the humans, who had been reduced to mere shadows of themselves. It was quite sad, and the giraffe race had taken pity on the humans and employed them on their ships, allowing them the access to new technologies. </p>
    <p>Arching his neck, Leo bit at the bowtie that was wound around his neck. He really didn’t get this new fashion. Bowties were itchy and restrictive, however, Mary, his personal human, said that it was the height of fashion and no one would take him seriously as captain if he didn’t stay on top of fashion. He, of course, felt like a common house pet. Those who dictated fashion were insane. </p>
    <p>Getting his fill on the leaves, Leo looked around for his second in command, Hellen. She was the pinnacle of giraffe beauty and intelligence. He was a little surprised that she hadn’t applied to be captain, for if she had, he would be the one as second in command and her the captain. He shook his head a bit, she had chosen to be second in command, and he wasn’t going to question her. </p>
    <p>That didn’t stop him from wondering what exactly she had planned however. Holding back that type of potential was cause to watch the person who held it back. And possibly encourage them to reach that potential. </p>
    <p>His long bony legs started to move as he recognized the familiar head of Hellen. She had wanted to meet him here for some reason. There had been a lack of eye contact, and Hellen was one who looked someone straight in the eye. Be they holding a ray gun or not. She was absolutely fearless. Obviously what she wanted to talk about scared her. Leo hoped that one of the male members of his crew wasn’t harassing her, he had thought that he had made it clear that there would be no harassment. </p>
    <p>Composing himself, Leo told himself not to jump to conclusions. A captain of an elite spaceship needed to know all the facts before making a decision. First he would hear Hellen out, then talk to any of the perpetrators or victims. Hellen could be coming to him about a different crewmate who was being harassed. They usually went to her about such problems. He was only notified if the problem was not coming to a close like it should. </p>
    <p>Meeting her between two trees, Leo bobbed his head in greeting. He noticed that she was wearing the red ribbon, around her right ear, he had given her at Christmas. He paused for a second; she had been acting a little strange since he had given her that ribbon. Maybe he had insulted her somehow. Some of the other tribes of giraffes had different customs; maybe red was a reason to fight in her tribe. </p>
    <p>It seemed that Hellen wasn’t going to start speaking as the silence between them stretched. Leo shifted from hoof to hoof, and finally broke the silence, “Hellen, what is it that you wanted to speak about.” He paused, before continuing, “If it is truly embarrassing we could go somewhere even more private.”

</p>
    <p>He hoped that it wasn’t too embarrassing; he wasn’t good about talking about female giraffe things. He had two sisters, and they still hadn’t prepared him for such talks. </p>
    <p>Hellen cleared her throat, and began to speak, her voice wavering. “Captain, I wish to talk to you about something very close to my heart.”</p>
    <p>Leo let out a mental sigh. Good, it wasn’t about female giraffe things. </p>
    <p>The fur around her cheeks seemed to darken as she cleared her throat yet again. “I have been having strange feelings that have only been described to me. They are interfering with my work, and I was told that the only way to get rid of them was to inform the object creating such feelings.”</p>
    <p>Leo tilted his head, this couldn’t possibly be going where he thought it was going. </p>
    <p>Hellen looked him directly in the eye and said, “Captain I believe I have a crush on you, though if might also be love. My fellow shipmates were unclear as to what love actually feels like, and so I am still unsure. The code for the crew has nothing about inter-crew relations, and I was hoping to start a relationship with you.”</p>
    <p>Leo couldn’t believe it. He had a crush on her ever since she had stepped foot on his ship. Pure bliss ran through his body, as he took a step forward. She gazed at him curiously, but didn’t take a step back. “I accept your proposal.” Was all he said before pecking her on the lips. </p>
    <p>Turning, he gestured with his head, “Will you join me for my favorite pastime?”</p>
    <p>A small smile graced Hellen’s lips, “I would love to Captain.”</p>
    <p>He flicked her with his tail as she got level with him, “Hellen, we are in a relationship, you must start calling me Leo.”</p>
    <p>Hellen smiled, “As you wish Leo. Now what is your favorite pastime?”</p>
    <p>“Why it is gazing at the stars of course. Though now they seem dim compared to your beauty.” Leo snickered as Hellen hid her head yet again. This would indeed be an interesting relationship. </p>

    <h1>Gravity of Clouds</h1>
    <p>Grav sat encompassed in the deer-hide chair, straining to read in the dying light. The invention of books and paper had been phenomenal in destroying his boredom. Sure, he had to lift many of the books he read from his fellow farmers or travel to find them, but they gave him solace in his solitude. </p>
    <p>Red dust glimmered as a breeze chewed at the brush, sunlight gleaming through bottles of colored glass. Swinging his legs from their prop on the wood stool, Grav stood and shuffled towards the creeping garbage that walled in his kitchen. He waded through the towers of stacked sacks, promising himself to take it out to burn when he got the time. </p>
    <p>Bright green wallpaper, newly glued, framed the city of dishes populated by food particles that only he could hold down by tiny black threads wrapped around the dishes, like vines, anchoring them to the spot. Grav started to root around in the icebox, looking for anything cool to eat. Finding nothing that didn’t have forest green growing on it, he retreated. Heaving himself back onto the chair, he relaxed into it. Flashing light drew his attention to the bottle-cluttered window where a single brown feather floated to the ground. </p>
    <p>Rubbing his eyes, he braced himself, waiting for the bad omen to walk through his door. He wasn’t disappointed. </p>
    <p>The wooden door flew open, banging against the dented wall. The silhouette of a human-sized barn owl stood in his doorway. One powerful wing reached to the back of the neck, releasing the true being at the unsnapping of a clip. Stepping over the crumbled skin, a white wooden doll walked gracefully towards him. </p>
    <p>“No wonder the locals are terrified of owls. Every time you fly here someone’s baby pops out with some deadly mutation.” Grav said, looking around his chair at Mut. “You need to have better control.”</p>
    <p>Mut shrugged, “It’s not my fault that the gene was already there, waiting to be exploited.” The wood on her arm starts to prickle with fur, her nose flattening and prickling with fur. Flinging herself into a waiting rabbit skinned chair, Mut sprawled, making herself at home. “I have a report from Eve. She has an idea for a the next experiment, but needs your help.”</p>
    <p>Scrapping the legs against the wooden floor, Grav adjusted so he was facing Mut. Black threads drooping towards the ground, covering his chair completely, “Why isn’t she here now?” he asked. </p>
    <p>“Had some things to talk to Math about. We’re trying to get permission for the experiment.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t think your going to get it.” Grav levered himself up. Brushing black threads from his grey eyes, he shuffled to the cupboard. Pulling out two cups, he asked, “Drink?”</p>
    <p>Mut swiveled her head, “No thanks.” He filled his cup up with water. “Why do you drink?”</p>
    <p>“Habit.” He said. </p>
    <p>“How’d it start again?”</p>
    <p>“The neighbors were too friendly.”</p>
    <p>“Ah, I remember them. They didn’t seem to like me and Eve.” Mut said. A smile spread, exposing the slow sharpening of her pearl teeth. </p>
    <p>“I wonder why?” Grav said, threads twitching. “Oh I know. You kept asking them about their recessive genes.”</p>
    <p>“It’s not my fault that we are ahead of the humans. They really need to catch up to us and stop thinking of us in the fantastical, mythical way.” Mut said, fingers tapping against the chair. “They can’t keep referring to me as Loki, though the Vikings were rather fun to drink with.”</p>
    <p>“They ran you out of their villages for playing tricks on them.” Grav said. </p>
    <p>“I was only exploiting their genes to make them more interesting.”</p>
    <p>“People rarely see it that way.” Grav leaned against the counter sipping at the water, a small comfort. “Do you think you’ll get permission?”</p>
    <p>“Of course, why wouldn’t we?” Mut asked. </p>
    <p>“Maybe because your last flying-human scheme failed so miserably that you were forced to call in Chem to euthanize all of them.” Grav said bitingly.</p>
    <p>“You do get attached to your humans don’t you.” Mut said. </p>
    <p>“Of course, I am connected to all of them, holding them down, renamed ‘the man’,” Grav performed air-quotes with a group of threads.  </p>
    <p>“Woah, calm down now, don’t want you releasing the living masses into space.” Mut’s flipper-hands waved in a calm-down motion. “Don’t want another dinosaur extinction, Eve really won’t forgive you then.”</p>
    <p>Grav huffed, sipping moodily at the water. Doing his breathing exercises to keep calm. </p>
    <p>“This time we are only going to have one at a time. Not a whole bunch.” Mut said, keeping her voice level. “This way we can keep them from breeding and escaping back to earth to make…what did they call themselves, Nephies. No. Nerphs, Nellies….” Mut kept muttering to herself, trying to remember. </p>
    <p>“Nephilim.” Grav supplied. </p>
    <p>“That’s it. That was a mess. Had to make so many diseases to kill them off, Chemistry and Elements just couldn’t handle it themselves.” Mut’s hands clutched at her cheeks, “But don’t worry. We are only going to perform the experiment on one person, and this newly established country is ripe with potential subjects.”</p>
    <p>“Well you’re going to have to choose quickly, states are already seceding, I predict a civil war will break out soon. You’ll have your work cut out for you to keep the chosen family alive.” Threads tossed two yellowed newspaper to Mut. She caught them and unrolled them. “The south is calling themselves the Confederate States of America. War will break out.”</p>
    <p>Mut smiled warmly at Grav, “No they won’t, this is just some landowners throwing a few tantrums. They’ll rejoin the union within the year. And why do you even care, you’re in the New Mexico Territory, no where near the conflict.” She started flipping through the magazine. “How’d you get these anyway? Have you started going out again?” Her black eyes started to bleed yellow, “I’m so proud of you. It’s been millions of years since you have left this house you built, by the way, looking sturdy.” </p>
    <p>Grav snorted, “I haven’t gone outside. I’ve been transporting things along the threads, they take care of me.” The threads flowed towards him; he reached out a hand and petted the group. They quivered in happiness.  </p>
    <p>Mut whistled, “Wow. Didn’t know you could do that. Did you tell Physics?”</p>
    <p>His nose wrinkled, “Of course. It’s rather hard for me to hide such a thing from Physics, he is my maker after all.”</p>
    <p>“You just don’t have a spine is all.” Mut teased. </p>
    <p>“Or I have the potential to kill everyone on this planet.” Grav said into his cup. </p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“Nothing. Now, why do you need me in this venture?”</p>
    <p>“We, Eve and I, wanted you to alter the gravity on the test subjects and to also help us pick them out. You have a lot more time on your hands than we do.” Mut said. She gave Grav her best smile, all jagged. </p>
    <p>Holding out his hand, he said, “Fine. Give me the files of the possible and I will have an answer within the week.”</p>
    <p>Mut pulled the papers from her bag. </p>
    <p>Handing them over, she gave Grav a big hug. “Thank you so much. We’ll have so much fun I know it.” Stepping into her suit, she pulled it on. “Next time I’ll bring Eve so you can have someone clean this place, it’s a dump.”</p>
    <p>“I know.” Grav said, starting to read the first file. A couple in Kentucky had caught their wayward eye. They wanted kids, and they already had the genetic markers that were prime for altering. Grav waved his hand as Mut said goodbye. He heard the door close, creaking a bit as it shook against the hinges. Grav looked in time to see Mut taking off. He would so much prefer to have her leave by horse or one of those new automobiles instead of by flight. He wasn’t that hard to get to. </p>
    <p>It took five generations for Eve and Mut to finally find their perfect child. It took a lot of interference on their part to get the proper genetic matches. Eve ranted about how sloppy and perpetually changing people were. She would push them towards one coffee shop where their perfect match was waiting and the target would suddenly change their mind, wanting soup instead. Grav would just nod his head and smile as he flipped through channels, looking for a movie he hadn’t seen.  </p>
    <p>Electricity, for once in his life, actually had a good idea. He had pushed all of the Concepts towards following in the modern human’s footsteps by getting televisions, cell phones and every new gadget that came out. It wasn’t hard to get the actually technology, what with having abilities to influence the world around people, altering their perception on what kind of money you are giving them, is child’s play. There were still a few walnuts in circulation, which was the reason vending machines would reject bills. Though with everyone going digital with paying, it became easier and easier to buy things. Since most of it is electrical pulses and data, data that can easily be faked. </p>
    <p>Grav’s favorite invention had been the Internet and computer. He didn’t need to leave his house to experience the world around him. He didn’t need to interact or talk to Eve and Mut without them having to fly all the way too him. He actually got to meet Nessy for the first and last time through Skype. She had died soon after from some kind of new pollutant in her loch. Eve and Mut hadn’t thought pollutants as a threat to Nessy, but they were wrong. </p>
    <p>Nessy had been a way for them to see if they could bring back dinosaurs. Which Grav still felt bad about, since that had been the only time he had lost control and accidentally released his hold on the overgrown reptiles. Since then, he had been locked away in his house for centuries, only coming out when Physics, Mut or Eve ordered him out. </p>
    <p>They always threatened to burn down his house if he didn’t leave. He couldn’t allow the flames to feed upon all the first editions that he had collected over the years. That was just barbaric. </p>
    <p>Eve and Mut had messaged him earlier that they were bringing someone over and he needed his suit. If he needed his suit, Grav had a suspicion that either Francis was coming over, or Mut and Eve’s new test subject was of proper age and they had somehow convinced them that they should come over.  </p>
    <p>Sliding into a suit, he smoothed out the tendrils that were trying to poke through. He would have to ask Genetic to grow him another suit. This one was starting to crack and he had to throw the first one away a while ago. Well more like burn it. Genetic was still trying to figure out what made them turn to goo after awhile. Toxic goo for that matter, slimy and full of floating pieces of cracked skin made Grav throw up a little every time he had to look at it.</p>
    <p>A hollow banging came from his door and he shuffled his way through the towers of books, garbage and movies. His house keeping had really gotten away from him after he had purchased the reinforced door with nine matching locks. There was just something about keeping his first editions safe from the outside world that garnered spending a little extra on the doors, plus it helped that Mut wasn’t knocking it down anymore. </p>
    <p>Flipping the three dead bolts open, twisting and pulling the two padlocks open, sliding the two chains, sliding a thin tendril along one sensor and twisting the key in the door knob finally released the airtight seal. </p>
    <p>Pulling the door towards him, he squinted his eyes as the New Mexican sun gleamed harshly into them. Mut and Eve stood in front of him…and Mut was cradling a toddler in her arms. </p>
    <p>“What is that?” he asked. </p>
    <p>Mut and Eve pushed passed him. “We had some trouble obtaining her, parents are so protective nowadays.” Eve said. </p>
    <p>“I blame the grandmother. Remember she got a glimpse of us in true form, and started to be overprotective of everyone.” Mut said as she cleared books off of one of the purple chairs before falling in it. “We barely lost the police half an hour ago. They were so persistent.”</p>
    <p>“You do realize you kidnapped a child?” he asked as he stared nervously at the child. “What did you do to her?” he didn’t think any kid would be sleeping as two deranged women took her from her parents. </p>
    <p>“She’s the test subject and technically came willingly.” Eve said, running her manicured suit hands through the girl’s dark brown hair.</p>
    <p>“Willingly? The police were chasing you. That speaks volumes against you.” He started to ring his hands, “I thought you were going to wait until she was at least of drinking age so she could drink her loneliness away!” </p>
    <p>Eve raised a delicate eyebrow of the heart shaped face she was wearing. “We grabbed her this early so that she would get acclimated and wouldn’t be lonely. It would defeat the process if she died of alcohol poisoning before the experiment is over.”</p>
    <p>Wringing his hands, he asked, “Are you sure Math is okay with this? Should we ask Gen to take care of her. Gen’s always been the nurturing type, she would enjoy this right? What about Francis? Taking care of a child is a full time thing. They need actual food, friends…”</p>
    <p> Mut pinched Grav’s cheeks together. “Breathe Gravity, breathe.” </p>
    <p>Grav breathed in through the suit’s nose, a whistle indicating misalignment whispered against Mut’s intruding hand. “Who do you think helped us knock her out? Lem of course. She was very generous with the chloroform.” Mut grinned. </p>
    <p>Pulling his face away from Mut’s grasp, Grav quickly skirted around the piles to Eve’s side. His hands fluttered over her head, as he tried to see if she was breathing. “You used chloroform? Is she all right?” he asked. The threads were starting to boil underneath the pale skin of his suit. </p>
    <p>Eve rolled her eyes towards his dirty white ceiling. Pushing the child into his arms, she turned to Mut. Jerking her head to the door, she said, “Come on, it’s time to go.”</p>
    <p>Mut leaned forward, green tinted blonde hair swinging forward, “But why? I want to say goodbye to Jo.” Mut jutted out her bottom lip, pouting at Eve, begging with her false blue eyes to stay and watch. </p>
    <p>Grav could only say syllables as his head, boiling with threads trying to get out, looked from Jo to Mut and Eve. </p>
    <p>“Mut, we need to get back to Francis. He is finally experiencing urges towards the opposite sex and we need to be there for him.” </p>
    <p>Mut worried her lip, eyes darting around the room. “But can’t you do that by yourself?”</p>
    <p>“I need someone to watch over Maggie. If we can convince Francis to make the first move, then we can possibly get Maggie interested.” Eve tapped her foot. “Now let’s go.” She swept her hand towards the door, as the other rested on the lip of her black pencil skirt. </p>
    <p>Mut’s head dropped as she slumped up from the chair. “Thanks for having us Grav. We’ll be in touch. Take good care of Jo.” Mut exaggerated her dragging feet as she passed Eve.  </p>
    <p>“Wait,” Grav said. He adjusted Jo to his hip, her head lolling backwards. His free hand shot up and pushed her head against his shoulder. “You’re leaving me with a toddler? Me! I can barely take care of myself, and you want me to take care of your forced volunteer?”</p>
    <p>“Yes.” Eve said. Looking down at her wrist, she sighed. “And we are bordering on being late of the time that I told Francis we would be there.” Turning on her pump-enclosed heel, Eve started herding Mut out of the door. “We’ll be back tomorrow with some groceries. Don’t worry she’ll be sleeping for a while and will probably throw-up when she wakes up. That’s a normal reaction to chloroform, you should have some crackers around here to settle her stomach.” Eve said as they quickly left his house. </p>
    <p>Grav shuffled towards them, cognizant of the sleeping toddler on his shoulder. He continued to call out to them, but his words were lost as two buzzards took flight, one black and one white. Mut and Eve had to stop flying in their more obvious suits because people were beginning to notice. Settlers had stayed away thinking him to be the devil, but Grav still wondered how he had stayed hidden. He wasn’t exactly hiding, he was just in the middle of nowhere, and had been there for centuries, though currently there was a highway that divided his desert. </p>
    <p>Grav sighed as he looked at the child in his arms. She didn’t deserve Mut and Eve’s drive to experiment. He wondered if the girl had even seen their true forms, but he doubted it. Mut and Eve probably grabbed and drugged her right away. He did have to wonder why they allowed the police to chase them when they could just jump from creature to creature or shape-shift. It would have been easy to carry the child off as giant eagles. </p>
    <p>Grav tried to picture the encounter, Mut jumping the gun and grabbing the child in view of everyone, Eve cursing her as she hoisted the child over her shoulder and the two running and dodging as people tried to stop them. Math had decreed that they couldn’t shape-shift in front of humans anymore, thus they would have had to make sure no one was around. Grav sighed as he turned back to his slowly decaying house. </p>
    <p>Faded green paint flecked from the side of the wooden structure, showing the bleached wood underneath. Rusted metal roofing deterred the rain from his one-story house. He would need to request an extension on his house and probably some reinforcement of the walls. If Mut and Eve were hoisting this responsibility on him, then he would need to actually do house work. </p>
    <p>Grav sighed, pinching at his suit. “Why did I need to put this on if the girl is out?” he asked the air. She hadn’t even been awake to scream ‘Boogeyman’ at him. Trudging through the dirt back inside, itching at his suit as the threads made patterns under his skin. He really needed a new suit, maybe one like Eve and Mut’s, one that could shape-shift. They were Gen’s newest line of suits. </p>
    <p>Placing the child on Mut’s cleared chair, Grav surveyed the well-lit room. He ran a hand over his face as he realized how much work he had. He didn’t dare take off the suit until after Jo had woken. Grav might be well read in the literary classics but he hadn’t brushed up on the elements and their chemical compounds. He never saw the point when he could just talk to Lem, the one who controls the elements, or Chem if he ever had a question. He would just have to trust Mut and Eve to have given her the right dosage. Leaning in close, Grav tried to tell if her coloring might have been off. If she didn’t wake by dinnertime, Grave was definitely calling in help. </p>
    <p>Brushing a hand through the greasy hair on his head he set to work, child-proofing his house. Which pretty much meant, detaching the dirt from the ceiling by making it too heavy, and sticking his first-edition classics up there. Jo would have to be able to fly to get at them. </p>
    <p>Next he started gathering up the garbage and moving it outside. He was able to clear out the kitchen, living room and bedroom in good order. He was reminded that his bedroom floor was made of wood with no carpet. Heaping all of the garbage in a pile that towered over his house, he made sure the gravity of each object attracted the objects around it and vice versa. This allowed for the garbage to stick together more solidly than if he had stuck them together with rubber cement. Stuffing newspaper into the cracks, he eased up on the attraction to allow good airflow and set fire to his garbage, he watched it a bit before heading inside. Windows facing towards the pile would allow him to watch the bonfire outside, incase it got too out of hand and caused a wild fire.</p>
    <p>Closing the door behind himself, he checked to make sure the smoke wasn’t going to blow into the house. He doubted that would be good for Jo after she had been forced to breathe in chloroform. Picking her up, he moved her to his bed where she could sleep more comfortably. </p>
    <p>Grav looked around, trying to see if he missed anything, not seeing anything he wondered if maybe he should vacuum or even wash the dishes. Sticking his head into his peeling kitchen, he glared a little at the dishes. They were only here because Grav enjoyed the task of eating; the various tastes and textures were taunts to his immortality and alien-ness to humanity. And if he didn’t have that hobby, he wouldn’t owe Eve who enjoyed cooking but not eating. He shook his finger at the dishes, “This is all your fault.” </p>
    <p>Releasing the gravity holding the dish city together, he allowed the plastic dishes to come crashing down onto the floor. He smiled in triumph as dishes and particles of food bounced helplessly on the bright yellow linoleum floor. Cackling to himself, he kicked a few dishes for good measure. “That’s what I think of your cooking Eve!”</p>
    <p>Hearing a groan from his bedroom, Grav leaned backwards to see if he could see Jo. She was trying to sit up, but like a newborn calf her arms weren’t supporting her weight. Going to her side, Grav made clucking noises. “Hey kiddo. Why don’t you lay down, two crazy ladies were being mean to you.” Grav pushed her gently down. </p>
    <p>“Mommy?” Jo asked. Still trying to sit up. </p>
    <p>“No, it’s just Uncle Grav.” Grav said. His eyes widened as he started to search for a bucket, as Jo grew very pale and started to open her mouth. Grav did not want vomit on his favorite cowboy sheets. </p>
    <p>Finding a bowl with sour milk crusted to the bottom, Grav flipped it upside down to empty what he could, and shoved it under Jo’s chin. Instantly stomach acid mixed with chunks of half-digested food spurted from her mouth. Grav gagged a little, being reminded of a deteriorating suit. </p>
    <p>“Keep that under your chin,” Grav urged as he ran to the kitchen. Grabbing up his cleanest towel and filling up a cup that only needed one rinse to get the dirt out, Grav had both outstretched to Jo as she tried to stay upright and vomit into the bowl. “You know, you’re the most considerate person right now and you’ve barely learned to talk. Good on you.” Grav said, as he crouched down, cup and towel still outstretched. </p>
    <p>Jo finally stopped vomiting, though the bowl was almost to it limit. Wiping her mouth with the towel and exchanging the bowl with a cup of water, Grav moved Jo off of his bed. “I bet you would like to sleep on actual sheets and not a naked mattress, huh?” </p>
    <p>Jo watched Grav with half-lidded brown eyes as she tried to drink the water. The cup was a little too big for her and most of the water ended up in her lap. And like most kids, she looked at her lap and cried. Grav tried making shushing noises as his hands fluttered around her, not positive on how to comfort her. She started hiccupping, and Grav wondered if more vomit was on its way. </p>
    <p>Placing the full bowl on the floor, he picked up another, this one much cleaner. Grabbing the cup away from her he shoved the bowl in her hands. “There, see bowl for your vomit.” His head worked back and forth as he searched for a way to calm her down. Seeing his cell phone, he lunged for it. Holding the four down he prayed Mut or Eve would pick up. He didn’t care that Francis the Bigfoot was finally noticing Maggie the Bigfoot instead of his science experiments. Such things paled in comparison to the crisis that was happening here. There was a crying child that didn’t seem to understand him, he didn’t do crying. How was that fair?</p>
    <p>Getting the voice mail, Grav kept turning his head to shush the little girl. “Please calm down! It’s not that bad.” Jo paused in her crying to stare at him. “What? Do I have something on my face?” Grav touched his face, and he groaned. There were holes in his face where bundles of threads were swaying around in happiness, egging on their brethren to push through the face. He heard a giggle, as Jo reached towards him small hand grasping towards the threads. “Oh thank god you think this is funny.” He unzipped his suit and allowed the threads free to curl around Jo, at least if she vomited on the threads he could transport it out. </p>
    <p>He continued to try Eve and Mut, but not as frenzied as before. All he was paying attention to were the little giggles and fewer and fewer vomiting noises as he allowed the threads to play with the little girl. A mouse thumped against the window as the wind picked up a bit. Grav looked towards the sky, searching for the hawk that was careless with its food. </p>
    <p>It took Grav hours of dialing and redialing before Eve picked up. He had almost called Gen to see if she would take the child. She was adorable, but Grav knew he didn’t have the qualifications to take care of her, he had to keep strict watch on his emotional state to make sure he didn’t accidently release humanity into space, or worse the other animals and plants. There was just something about forced cannibalism that didn’t strike Grav’s fancy. </p>
    <p>“What?” Eve asked. </p>
    <p>“When are you coming to get Jo?” Grav asked, his threads rocking Jo gently as she slept.</p>
    <p>“I thought I already explained this. You are taking care of her, but you’ll need to keep your suit on, she screamed the first time she saw me and Mut in our suits.”</p>
    <p>“You showed yourself to her?” </p>
    <p>“Yes, her screams attracted her parents and we had to leave without her. She was fighting us too much.” Eve said. “Is that it?”</p>
    <p>“But Eve you need to take her! I just barely got her to calm down and that was only because she finds my threads fascinating.” Grav said. He glanced over at Jo, his house didn’t even have a proper bathroom, he couldn’t make her go outside. “I don’t even have a bathroom.”</p>
    <p>“So?” Eve asked. </p>
    <p>“Is it Grav?” Mut screamed in the background. </p>
    <p>Grav rubbed the bridge of his long nose as he listened to Mut and Eve grappling over the phone. “Hi Grav, is Jo awake? Did she vomit?” Mut won. </p>
    <p>“Yes, now when are you going to take her? I have books stuck to the ceiling so she doesn’t damage them.” Grav asked. </p>
    <p>“Oh Grav, we told you, you’re taking care of her. She won’t be found with you, you’re on the other side of the country from her home, and you were born to take care of children.” </p>
    <p>“No, I was created to regulate the gravitational pull of objects, not take care of a child. I live out here for a reason, Mut, it’s to stay away from people!” </p>
    <p>“Fine.” Mut said. “Give us a couple weeks to find someone to take care of her. Maybe we can get a human to be a surrogate.”</p>
    <p>Grav thanked Mut and hung up the phone. Leaning against a dented bookshelf, Grav smiled as his threads made a nest around Jo, trying to protect her from the experiment filled future ahead of her. As Grav watched the sun set he wondered what type of family Jo would be given too. He hoped that they wouldn’t get Lect to take care of her; he was as unpredictable as the lightening in thunderstorms that he liked generating. He allowed the threads that connected him to everything bring the sounds of a symphony into the bedroom. He hummed along as he continued to watch over Jo.</p>
    <p>Days slowly turned into weeks, which turned into months as Mut continued to search for a surrogate. Grav had to admit that he was getting rather attached to Jo, but it was still not safe for her to stay with him. Though he had to admit that his house had never been cleaner. </p>
    <p>The renovations to the house came along easily enough to where Jo had her own toilet and bedroom filled with toys and pictures. Grav had tracked down Jo’s parents, but hadn’t gotten a hold of them. He watched as they worried about their daughter, and nationwide search looked for the girl. Grav felt bad about not letting the parents know that Jo was alright and where she was, but then he would be dragged into this whole mess, he would have to go outside and confront people. </p>
    <p>Messy, emotional people. Grav could barely handle a little girl, but not emotional parents on top of that. Though Grav had to say that Jo was quite adorable. Her rosy cheeks and toothy grin as she scurried around the house. He didn’t let her out much, mostly because it was a pain to unlock the door and he was pretty sure coyotes could carry her off very easily. </p>
    <p>Grav sipped at his dust free encrusted glass as he watched an animated ballerina on the screen. Jo was cooing at the television as the ballerina twirled and pranced. She had tried to imitate the show, but had ended up on her behind before giving up after a while. </p>
    <p>Grav’s eyes shifted towards his phone as it began to vibrate against the coffee table. Picking up the phone, he grunted. </p>
    <p>“Have you started getting her used to heights?” Eve asked. </p>
    <p>“Have you found Jo a home?”</p>
    <p>“You’re taking care of her just fine and it makes this experiment easier. We don’t have to continuously invade your space.” Eve said. </p>
    <p>“Well I guess that is all right. Why do I need to acclimate Jo? Isn’t this already in her DNA?”</p>
    <p>“Yes and no. Fear can be a powerful thing and we would rather nip it in the bud.” Eve said, “Now get on it. We’ll be over in a couple weeks.”</p>
    <p>“Yes and no. Fear can be a powerful thing and we would rather nip it in the bud.” Eve said, “Now get on it. We’ll be over in a couple weeks.”</p>
    <p>It was easier than Grav thought to get Jo accustomed to floating a few feet off the ground. She rather enjoyed it actually. Tackling his threads was her way of saying up. He would hold her up, and increase the gravity of certain objects to propel her forward or backwards. He sometimes wondered if this was how it felt to teach someone to ride a bike. It felt rather good. </p>
    <p>The only thing Grav had to watch for was Jo’s new want to fling herself off things. This, as any caregiver knew, was a safety risk for the child. In response, Jo had her own contingent of threads that followed her everywhere, even if Grav wasn’t in the room. </p>
    <p>Eve and Mut would visit on occasion, bringing new supplies to restock the growing kitchen. Grav had to expand his house several times as Jo slowly grew into adulthood. She learned and knew the world through Grav, Mut and Eve. Jo had continuously complained that they were keeping her trapped, but they would brush it off. Telling her that if the world found her the governments and scientists would want to study her. </p>
    <p>Well, not completely true.</p>
    <p>They would probably want to track the Concepts down and lock them away for study, or just lock her up into an insane asylum. </p>
    <p>On very rare occasions, Grav did take her to observe people. Not necessarily interact with, but observe. From way up in the clouds, it was rather enjoyable to watch as people scurried around. Grav could manipulate how close clouds were to the ground, and he and Jo would just sit and watch them. It was kind of a game of hide-and-seek, where if someone looked up Grav and Jo would quickly duck back into the cloud. Or if a plane flew overhead, they would wrap themselves in the cloud, and wait. </p>
    <p>Grav wondered what he would do when Jo finally had to go. Maybe go back to watching his movies, and molding into his chair. But his house was so much bigger now. It had whispers and emotions that Grav didn’t know if he could take on by himself. Well Jo would need a house up here, Grav had been thinking about moving. He was starting to get neighbors. Yes, it was definitely time to move. </p>
    <p>As Jo neared the age of 21, she was getting more and more stir-crazy. Grav had to keep her under perpetual surveillance to keep her from running away. It was grating on both their nerves. It happened again tonight while he had been watching one of the new shows on NBC. Sometimes getting free cable was great. </p>
    <p>His threads shivered, as a window opened upstairs. Not bothering to get up, Grav pushed himself through the threads and remolded himself in Jo’s bedroom. Her dark blue walls imitated the sky right before full darkness. The books and movies lining the walls gave her passions away, fantasy, photography, language. It was all there, ready to read and inspire. </p>
    <p>“Jo.” Grav said. </p>
    <p>Her shoulders slumped as she fell back into her room. “Ah come on, just one night. All I need is one night and I will stop sneaking out.”</p>
    <p>“That’s what you said the last time when I actually let you.” Grav said. </p>
    <p>Rolling to her stomach, Jo groaned. “Really? You’re going to keep me couped up? I know I’m a science experiment, but I don’t interact with any of the other experiments. I’m beginning to think that there aren’t any others.” </p>
    <p>Grav sat on her bed, “Francis is very real, and even more hermit-ish than I am.” His threads started to flow around the room, checking the objects for danger to Jo. “If you are a success, then Eve and Mut have a ton of people that are lined up to join you. Which reminds me, you are old enough to move to the clouds permanently. Isn’t that great?”</p>
    <p>Jo shot up, her back making a ‘u’, “Really? Does that mean I can go anywhere by myself?”</p>
    <p>Grav’s threads drooped a little, “Well yes. I was going to ask if you wanted this house or your very own. Books surprisingly don’t do well when they are up in the air surrounded by precipitation.”</p>
    <p>Jo rolled to her feet, “Doesn’t Francis have that machine that hardens clouds into viable structures? Couldn’t I use that?”</p>
    <p>“Where did you hear about that?” </p>
    <p>“One of the nights you were talking to Mut and Eve.” Jo tapped her finger to her lip as she fell into her purple office chair. “When do I get to meet the other Concepts?”</p>
    <p>“Eve and Mut don’t think that would be a good idea.”</p>
    <p>“Do you always do what Eve and Mut say?”</p>
    <p>“Not all the time, sometimes I do what Physics says.” Grav tapered off, his threads drooping further. His self-forced isolation did limit his interaction with the other Concepts. Really he only heard stories about them, nothing much more than that. Physics, Mut and Eve were the only ones who visited. </p>
    <p>“I’ve never met Physics, he’s your maker yeah?”</p>
    <p>“Yeah, and you have surely met Physics. He comes by at least once a week.”</p>
    <p>“No I am always with Mut and Eve. The only time I get to interact with actual people.”</p>
    <p>“Surely that’s not right.” Grav muttered to himself. His threads slithered and grappled with one another. Standing he started shuffling towards the door, pausing he said, “Don’t try to sneak out. I try to get Francis over so he can teach you how to use his machine.” </p>
    <p>Jo nodded as she watched him curiously. Grav continued down the stairs, conflicted about Jo not meeting Physics. He had asked about the additions to the house, and Grav had told him the truth. He now found it weird that Physics hadn’t ever seemed more curious about it. Maybe he thought that Grav had finally gone off the deep end and was seeing people and interacting. That would explain why Physics watched his threads, always a dead give away to his emotional and mental state. Since they hadn’t acted up much, Physics must not be too worried about Grav neglecting his duties. </p>
    <p>Sliding into his worn chair, he was happy to find that Jo didn’t try to escape again that night. </p>
    <p>It took a week before Mut and Eve were sure Jo was ready. The party was small and in the clouds. They seemed more jittery than usual. Mut’s true form was morphing faster than usual, and Eve wasn’t changing at all, not even the slow pace she usually changed at. Grav knew something was wrong, but didn’t know how to confront them about it. </p>
    <p>Of course, he could be over thinking this. Something could be wrong with Francis. That had to be it, Francis was probably having one of his hermit phases. Which would be a problem, since they needed to have him explain how his Gùtǐ worked. Grav didn’t understand where Francis’ fascination for the Chinese language came from, but it did lend to some interesting direct translations.</p>
    <p>Grav busied himself around the near spotless house as he waited for Mut, Eve and Francis to arrive. They were on the late side, but that wasn’t anything weird. Jo sat on her black suede chair, suitcases lined neatly along the wall. Her hands rubbed together as her head swiveled around the room. </p>
    <p>“Do you think my parents ever think of me?”</p>
    <p>Grav’s threads wrapped around the plate he was holding as his hands loosened their grip. “I bet they do. Probably never stopped hoping.” They didn’t talk about her parents often, though on her birthday, Grav would observe them with her. </p>
    <p>“I know why I can’t really see them, but sometimes I wonder.”</p>
    <p>“I know.” He said. “I didn’t talk to Eve and Mut for a week after they dropped you on my doorstep.”</p>
    <p>Jo giggled. “No you didn’t.”</p>
    <p>Grav smiled at Jo, “Yeah, I was calling them every ten minutes. It wasn’t safe here for you.”</p>
    <p>“Probably safer than out there.” </p>
    <p>“You don’t know that.”</p>
    <p>“I watch the news.”</p>
    <p>“That doesn’t say anything about the world. It is wondrous and magical. Just a little chaotic.”</p>
    <p>“Then why don’t you ever go out by yourself.”</p>
    <p>The threads twirled around Grav, “I’m connected to everyone, why would I need to go outside?”</p>
    <p>“What about the other Concepts? Don’t they wonder about you?”</p>
    <p>“No. They know the danger.” He muttered. </p>
    <p>“What danger? You’re the most kind person in the world.”</p>
    <p>“Doesn’t mean I’m not dangerous.”</p>
    <p>Jo laid a hand on his shoulder, “Promise me that when I leave you won’t continue to lock yourself up here?”</p>
    <p>He looked away, scanning for a blemish on the plate. “I can’t do that. I can’t forgive myself if I harmed another species.”</p>
    <p>“What are you even talking about?” Jo asked.</p>
    <p>He was saved by a pounding on the door. Unlocking the nine rusted locks, Grav stepped aside for Mut, Eve and a hunched Francis to come through. Francis looked everything like what a Bigfoot should look like, except he had on tan slacks and a tie. He stared nervously at the threads that cloaked Grav, before sweeping his gaze to Jo. Holding out a hand, he said, “P-pleasure to m-meet you.” </p>
    <p>Jo smiled as she pumped Francis’ hand up and down. “Oh it really is a pleasure. I’ve heard so much about you.” Standing she slapped him on the back for good measure, “Us experiments need to stick together after all.”</p>
    <p>“Experiments?” Came from the door. </p>
    <p>Grav turned his head, and smiled. “Hey Phys, glad you could make it.”</p>
    <p>He gestured for Physics to come inside, but he didn’t move. “What do you mean experiments? Mutation, Evolution explain.” Phys strode in, tailcoat billowing. He was the most human looking of all the concepts, Grav theorized because he was one of the first of the concepts that Math created. He didn’t need a suit, because of his similarities to humans. He only had to wear clothing from head to toe and foundation on his face, to hide the equations and that morphed and moved around his body. </p>
    <p>Mut shrank behind Eve. “We were taking an initiative.” Eve said, barely above a whisper. </p>
    <p>“What? You mean this wasn’t approved?” Grav asked, moving his threads so they made a small barrier between Phys and Jo. Francis ducked behind it too, gripping the Gùtǐ to his chest. </p>
    <p>“No Grav, this was an unapproved experiment.” Phys said soothingly. “I should have known from the beginning, but I thought you were just making up people.”</p>
    <p>Grav was a little hurt. “Why?”</p>
    <p>“You were lonely, we all could see it. These two,” he gestured to Eve and Mut, “were probably trying to make you feel better by giving you a pet to take care of.”</p>
    <p>“She’s not a pet.” Grav said, threads thrashed and stood rigidly. “Jo, we’re leaving.”</p>
    <p>“Grav don’t do this. Just let her go, she’s just a human.” Phys said. </p>
    <p>“Isn’t that enough? We only regulate this world, nothing else.” Grav asked. </p>
    <p>“Exactly. We shouldn’t be messing with humans.”</p>
    <p>“But we alter other animals so they can evolve.” Eve said, stepping in front of Grav. “Why can’t we help humans evolve, we did centuries ago. If Mut and I hadn’t experimented all those years ago, humans wouldn’t be where they are today.” </p>
    <p>“Humans weren’t meant to fly!” Phys said. Equations were starting to roam his face. “We saw this years ago!”</p>
    <p>“I’m not the first?” Jo asked. </p>
    <p>“No, that’s where angels come from. They grew out of control and we had to euthanize them.” Eve said. Her form was slowly shifting to a bigger form. </p>
    <p>Grav moved along his threads and made sure Jo was blocked from Phys. “But she’s different, Jo can make it.”</p>
    <p>“But what about the future flyers? They won’t be as lucky.” Phys said. Stepping forward, trying to get a better shot at Jo. </p>
    <p>Grav’s threads had gone still, he was acutely aware of the gravity around him. “No she won’t. I’ll prove it to you.” Wrapping Jo in the threads, he disappeared from the house, the last thing he heard was a “No!” He couldn’t discern the voice.</p>
    <p>The burning colors of twilight blinded Grav as he unwrapped Jo. Huge clouds surrounded them. Grav sighed, “We’ll have to keep moving. Maybe even separate for a time. No, that won’t work. The other Concepts might find you! What then, we don’t know that they are on your side. Why didn’t Eve and Mut tell me from the beginning that they didn’t have permission?”</p>
    <p>“Because then you wouldn’t have gone with it.” Jo supplied. Her arms were wrapped around herself, shielding herself form the cold. </p>
    <p>“You don’t know that.”</p>
    <p>“Yes I do, I have been living with you for the majority of my life. Grav, you don’t like to go against Phys. I could see that even without meeting him. Though he is a rather huge dick.” Jo said. </p>
    <p>“But why did they have to lie to me?”</p>
    <p>“Do I need to repeat myself?” Jo asked. </p>
    <p>Grav felt winded. “I don’t want to be that person though.”</p>
    <p>“But you’re not a person.”</p>
    <p>“I know.” Grav felt small, smaller than he had ever felt before. </p>
    <p>Jo placed her hand on his shoulder. “Don’t worry, we’ll get through this.” Bringing her hand up, she coughed a little. </p>
    <p>Grav’s head snapped up as he grabbed her face in his hands. “What’s wrong?”</p>
    <p>“Just need to get some oxygen, been a while since I’ve been up here.” Jo assured him. </p>
    <p>“No, no.” Grav looked around wildly until he saw her. Liquid to gas to solid, perpetually reacting strode Chem. “Please. Please stop this Chem. It will work. Just wait.”</p>
    <p>Chem held up her hand, as she got closer, Jo started to cough and gag. </p>
    <p>“Stop it! Stop it!” Grav’s threads lashed out, wrapping around Chem’s hand as he flung her away from them. His threads were in a frenzy and grav didn’t notice the loosening of the elements. </p>
    <p>Chem’s red eyes widened as she backed away. “This has to be done, Grav. You know it.”</p>
    <p>“No it doesn’t!” The threads gathered together and speared towards Chem. “You will leave us alone.”</p>
    <p>“Grav!” </p>
    <p>“It’s all right Jo. I’ll protect you.” Grav said without turning to look at her. “Everything will be all right.”</p>
    <p>“No it won’t Grav. Look at what’s happening around you!” Phys shouted, appearing in a cloud of ‘E=mc2’s. “You are losing control!”</p>
    <p>Grav laughed, “If I could raise a child without losing control, I think I can handle protecting Jo.” He directed threads to ward off Phys.</p>
    <p>“Grav! Help me!”</p>
    <p>Grav whipped around, looking towards Jo who was barely holding onto a clump of threads. Her hair floated around her, she had lost all gravity. “No, no, no.”</p>
    <p>“Grav calm down. We can talk about this.” Phys soothed. “We can maybe let this little experiment go forward.”</p>
    <p>“But she’s an abomination!” Chem said. </p>
    <p>Phys shushed her, “Compared to keeping the rest of the world in tact, I’ll risk letting an abomination live.”</p>
    <p>“She’s not an abomination!” Grav said. </p>
    <p>“Okay, okay.” Phys held up his hands, trying to sooth him.</p>
    <p>Grav tried wrapping threads around Jo, but they kept falling away. Black tears, ran down his face, “I can’t lose you.”</p>
    <p>Jo smiled at him, “You’re not going to lose me. Remember you are always in control.” Her fear ridden eyes gave her away slightly, as she grasped and re-grasped the threads. “Just don’t let go.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll try.” Grav tried to sooth the roiling emotions within his gut, but he couldn’t focus. All that focus he had built up wasn’t there, and the fear of that gnawed and destroyed and fortifications of focus he could muster. “I can’t do it.”</p>
    <p>“Yes you can, you’ve done it so many times.” Phys said, stepping closer. “Let me assist.”</p>
    <p>“I should do this on my own.”</p>
    <p>“But isn’t that what got you in this mess.”</p>
    <p>“No. Other’s got me into this mess.” Grav said, eyes unfocusing. He was falling, and Jo was forever going to be in the clouds. That was better than Chem choking and smothering her with toxic gases. She would be free. Wasn’t that better than being tethered to him. “Be free Jo.” He whispered, as the threads released her hands. </p>
    <p>She screamed, reaching towards him as she floated passed the atmosphere and into deep space. She could finally live among the stars. </p>
    <p>“You did the right thing.” Phys said, stepping up and putting his hand on Grav’s shoulder. </p>
    <p>Grav looked with dead eyes. “I have truly learned something about myself. I was never made for company.” With that, Grav disappeared with a slither of his threads, returning home. </p>
    <p>Mut, Eve and Francis surrounded him, asking where Jo was, what had happened, and if he was all right. He pushed them away and locked his nine rusty locks. Settling himself into his molded chair, Grav put in his favorite movie. Realizing that monotony was the only thing for him, and anything else was suicide for those around him. </p>
    <p>He turned up the volume to drown out the pounding on his door.  </p>

    <h1>In which Jacob Winsor Became a Doll and the Consequences that Followed</h1>
    <p>I am in love with Elsie Kay Tolk.</p>
    <p>She is beautiful, knows what she wants, and speaks her mind. But at the same time she is reserved, doesn’t flaunt her power, and she is gracious. She is everything I want in a woman, everything that made me want to know and love her.</p>
    <p>If only I had a body. </p>
    <p>At least I could still be with her, see her, and interact with her. Being in love with someone who is part of the physical realm can be a little tricky, but I managed. I knew what she wanted, needed, and craved. </p>
    <p>Information.</p>
    <p>Information gathering was more than just a job for her, it was what made her world go round. For as long as I had known her, she was always trying to learn more. Elsie differed from regular intelligence agents in that she had a whole other pool of resources that she could tap into. Being a necromancer allowed her to call upon the spirits both trapped on the living plane and in the spiritual plane. It made gathering information much easier. </p>
    <p>All necromancers, by trade, are intelligence gatherers, in one way or another. Most helped magical law enforcement or gathered intelligence for the various magical councils; however, having the ability to become a necromancer was on the rare side. Being a competent necromancer was something else entirely. Necromancers liked being in the shadows, listening to the secrets of their fellow man. It was rare to see one flaunting their powers to anyone but spirits. </p>
    <p>The High Council made sure to regulate the necromancers though. Dealing with sensitive information made necromancers powerful and dangerous enemies. Plus, it was never smart to tick off a necromancer, they may have stopped the practice of summoning zombies, spirit warriors, or grims, but that didn’t mean they didn’t know how. On occasion the council had to intervene before such disasters could be realized. </p>
    <p>Elsie is one of their best agent. She put all her time looking into organizations and people, driving herself to know more. She exhausted all her resources before making a report, polishing it meticulously of errors and rumors. </p>
    <p>That’s where I come in. Ghosts, being dead and within their realm of power, were a necromancer’s biggest source of information. We had access to every part of the world of the living, making us ideal spies and secret keepers of necromancers. We gleaned an awful lot of the world that kept turning without us. We pick up dialects, learn new trivia, and place bets on escalating situations. The physical realm was our television, and we enjoyed watching. However, windows that didn’t naturally open took vast amounts of energy on our part. As such, we asked a price for the information we gathered.  </p>
    <p>The rules of magic dictated an equal exchange for spells and the exchange of goods. We may be dead, but we weren’t going to give anything away for free. Sure we could give information for free, but the necromancers would not be able to trust their source. Receiving payment compelled spirits to tell the truth, after all, if a necromancer found out the spirit lied, the necromancer was within their right to revoke the payment. Which is a rather embarrassing predicament for the spirit at hand.</p>
    <p>Information may have been the love of Elsie’s life, but she was still human. They were there, those physical distractions that tried to grab her attention. Sometimes flowers would grace her grey workroom, giving it a bit more life than what usually appeared in that dank room full of death and documents. </p>
    <p>I would look on curiously, wondering if maybe the Elsie I knew was different when she wasn’t in this room. But I knew she wasn’t. Sometimes I checked in on her from the spirit realm. I didn’t do this much, since necromancers can sense when a window between our two worlds is opened near them. They don’t particularly like being checked up on, it encroaches upon their privacy.</p>
    <p>Feeling the familiar tug of being summoned, I answered readily, knowing I would see my beloved, even when she couldn’t see me. Light surrounded me, gently taking me to the living world. A world that had left me and my past behind. </p>
    <p>Opening my eyes, I was greeted by the familiar room. Boxes full of documents lined the walls, hinting at the obsession of the owner. My eyes flicked to the old, worn, wooden door, as images flipped through my mind. I reconstructed the glimpses I had gathered through my spying. </p>
    <p>I started to go through the list of various things I generally asked for payment. I decided I didn’t want any new books, I had already gathered enough as it is. Many of my fellow spirits were in awe of my book collection, but it was truly small compared to what Elsie had. Her library was mostly filled with reports and fact books; Elsie had a slight disdain for the Internet and preferred a physical book for fact checking. </p>
    <p>Standing before me with groomed, golden strands rippling down her back, Elsie looked over a notebook. She held it delicately in her gloved hands; questions written in her swirling handwriting. I wondered if she was still investigating Johnathan Boyle. I hoped not, I had found nothing new pertaining to the oil tycoon. Though he was still supplying the underground with dragon parts, the despicable bastard. Dragons were nearly extinct as it were and the councils preferred if poachers would stop hunting the beasts. </p>
    <p>Hopefully she had something new, I disliked watching him take apart the fire-breathing lizards. It was a rather messy endeavor. </p>
    <p>She looked thinner than before. Her black pants cinched tightly around her waist, while a violet, silk shirt tucked into her pants, hiding her thin frame in the flowing fabric. And a black trench coat tried to shadow the thinness from view. Her cheeks had hallowed a little more, but her eyes, those deep brown eyes framed with dark circles from lack of sleep, still sparkled with curiosity. </p>
    <p>She had forgotten to eat and sleep again. </p>
    <p>Magic kept her alive, but only barely. There was some benefit to being a necromancer. Magic flowed through her veins pumping life through her body. She had a bad habit of forgetting to eat and sleep while doing her job, deciphering information. Sometimes, I could get her to eat or sleep as payment to me. Other times she refused, shoving a romance novel in my hands and sending me on my way. For some reason she assumed that when I asked for a book that I wanted a romance novel. I sometimes wondered if Elsie had a stash near her bed, the bindings gave hints that they had been read. </p>
    <p>“Hello Elsie.” I said. I ran a hand through my hair, hoping that this time she would be able to see me.  </p>
    <p>“Took you long enough. Still looking at me with those doe eyes?” Elsie asked, not looking up. </p>
    <p>“You haven’t been eating or sleeping.” I said. She might have perfect hygiene but that wouldn’t matter if her magic faltered. </p>
    <p>She grunted. Flipping the notebook over, she asked, “What would you like in payment?” Leveling her pen at me, she added, “Don’t ask for me to eat or take a nap. I wasted an entire day in bed from that.”</p>
    <p>I floated around the perimeter of the circle that had been drawn around me, contemplating what I would ask for. She had used salt again today, instead of the necromancer preferred, Grade A red paint. </p>
    <p>Red, such a dark color. Images of my knee being shattered and my best friend standing over me, leveling a gun flitted behind my eyes. Elsie stopped using red paint after I let this slip. She did care, in the non-showy way. </p>
    <p>“I don’t have all day for you to decide.” She said. Scribbling something into her notebook, the wheels always turning. </p>
    <p>My eyes landed on a doll, one of the seemingly rare male dolls, sitting precariously on the edge of a shelf between two brown, nondescript boxes. “Enchant a vessel for me, so as to allow me to travel between our worlds.” </p>
    <p>The easiest vessel would be the doll, being the most human like thing in the room. </p>
    <p>“No,” She responded. </p>
    <p>I froze. “Why not?”</p>
    <p>“Lack of a body.”</p>
    <p>I curse. She grunts in disapproval at my language. If only I had told the reaper to go screw himself, I might have a chance. Then again, she might not travel to the middle of nowhere to find a ghost. Having a piece of my decayed body made it easier to enchant a vessel, giving that extra connection to the spirit. </p>
    <p>“That’s my price.” I said. Steeling my spine. Elsie could figure it out, she just needed a push.</p>
    <p>Her dark brown eyes looked up, studying the air to my left. She still didn’t know my face. “Why? It’s a dismal world, it hasn’t changed.”</p>
    <p>“Doesn’t matter.” I said shortly. “This is my price.”</p>
    <p>“Fine,” She agreed. “I’ll call you when I am done. In the meantime you might as well look into Hamish Wall, it seems the council is most displeased with him. I want to know if there is even cause for concern.”</p>
    <p>Elsie was honorable in that sense, she never asked for information if she wasn’t positive she could pay. </p>
    <p>I almost got a thank you in before she reversed the spell, pushing me back to the spiritual plane, to this dismal world muted in color. Nothing was substantial, we didn’t have a purpose here, except for wishing for something we never would have again. Life. </p>
    <p>Buildings floated through the space, while small platforms littered in between the buidlings. Spirits gathered on, near, and even in the buildings and platforms, talking with each other. It was sort of like the real world, except there wasn’t much sense of direction. Something could be hundreds of miles away, though it would only take us a minute, while other destinations would look closer but would take more than an hour to get to. The spiritual plane was fickle like that.  </p>
    <p>The array of spirits were as diverse as those that were living. Some got bored enough to learn to control their forms. Currently, the trending fashion right now is to show how you died. Those who died in their sleep were slightly out of luck; they perpetually looked like they were sleeping if they followed this trend. </p>
    <p>Last year it was fashionable to look like you have been beaten to death. The molted colors hadn’t made the best results, and many of the spirits had looked more like muted peacock than anything else. The year before that, grotesque deformities were in. </p>
    <p>Even in life, I still didn’t understand the draw towards fashion. It all looked very silly. Especially when they were hoping for more vibrant colors. Colors were severely muted in this world, most of them looking more like shades of grey than anything else. </p>
    <p>I wonder if our brethren trapped on the natural plain also went through phases. Sometimes I do wish I had stayed, but then I would have had to watch my ex-lover and ex-best friend have a family, survive, and live life happily. </p>
    <p>Truthfully, I don’t even know if they were happy, I never checked up on them. In my nightmares they are laughing over my corpse and having a merry time. Celebrating that they were free of me, though I don’t know why. It wasn’t like I was a horrible person, I like to think I was rather nice. Plus, I haven’t seen them on this plane, so I have to wonder if they stayed on the natural plane. I would assume so, I have traveled to every corner of the spiritual plane and still haven’t run into them. Or we could just be missing each other at every turn. </p>
    <p>Floating along, I watched as little ghostly children imitated play. They still believed that they were alive, just in a magical world with simpler rules. The necromancers never called on children, it was too dangerous to call upon children after all. One never knew when they were calling a demon or a child; they felt very much the same. </p>
    <p>As I continued along, I remembered when I had first met Elsie, she was summoning her first spirit. Red paint decorated the floor, keeping me within my bounds. I cringed a little, still reacting to the color red after all this time. Circles and sigils were drawn with a sure hand, I recognized the protection and entrapment sigils surrounding my circle. Surprisingly not all spirits were kind and helpful. There were some who would want to do an 18 year old girl serious harm. </p>
    <p>Her mentor stood in the corner, permanent frown in place. I never heard the man say a word of encouragement to Elsie, actually I never heard him speak, but she always held her head up high never faltering. Maybe he said it in private, wouldn’t want us ghosts telling the other necromancers about their weaknesses after all. </p>
    <p>Elsie had looked healthier back then. Cheeks plumb, brown eyes still sparkling. She was still as angelic as she was now. I still looked like I was 20 years old, ready to take on the world, but stopped before I could reach my potential. </p>
    <p>I was a little surprised to see a necromancer so young summoning a ghost, most don’t summon their first ghost until about four years into the apprenticeship. Necromancers didn’t take anyone younger than 18. Most didn’t show potential before then. But it seemed this girl was special. </p>
    <p>It wasn’t surprising; prodigies were what moved the magical realm forward. They were rare, but not unheard of. This girl had probably been showing signs of being a necromancer at an early age, and now she was prepared enough to be welcomed into the fold of information gatherers. </p>
    <p>She was just beginning the hands on training. I was her first ghost. I knew because we spirits like to gossip about the apprentices, and I hadn’t heard anything about this girl. Most who were chosen as first ghost liked to keep tabs on the apprentice, just in case their young necromancer out shown the others. It was a source of pride being able to say that we were their first. </p>
    <p>Though, summoning spirits is dangerous, especially if you get the symbols and circle wrong. A broken circle will not retain a spirit, and could very well release a spirit into the world. Now this isn’t generally a problem, unless that spirit leans towards antagonistic behavior. Spirits are creatures of energy and we can do quite a bit of damage when we need to. </p>
    <p>“Hello child.” I greeted. One can always tell what kind of person someone is by how they react to being called young. There were people who took it as a compliment, those who brushed it off, and those who were offended. I wondered what kind of woman she was. </p>
    <p>“Greetings sir.” She said formally with a bow. </p>
    <p>I raised my eyebrows, surprised by her formality. Few necromancy mentors taught any manners anymore. It was answer this, answer that, no pleases or thank you’s. They generally had to be reminded that we needed payment. Which gets annoying after awhile. </p>
    <p>I smiled kindly at her, reclining my head in recognition of her honoring me. “What is your name angel?” It was a bit out of line for me to call her angel, but she was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise dull and ungrateful world. I watched as her mentor took a step forward, warning me to back down. He didn’t like that I had complimented his apprentice in such a familiar way. “I mean no disrespect of course.” I amended, not wanting to be sent away before I knew her name. </p>
    <p>He didn’t have to do much to make others intimidated, what with him standing at six feet, bald, black and muscular. Before I knew his name I referred to him as Mr. Smiley. Of course I wouldn’t tell him that, especially when I found out his real name, Carl Smith. Not necessarily a terrifying name, but I still wasn’t going to bring it up</p>
    <p>Carl was a world-renowned necromancer that had never taken on an apprentice. Not even when the council had forced apprentices on him. He was scary enough to scare the magic right out of the apprentices, which is quite a feat unto itself. Most of the spirits who dealt with him never even though of toeing the line, not wanting to anger such a renowned necromancer. With such a reputation I was surprised that he even had an apprentice.</p>
    <p>This girl was special indeed.</p>
    <p>I had requested her name for the sole reason of keeping track of her. Knowing names would allow me to know when she was searching for a ghost again. How she said her name gave a sort of feel to her magic and spells. It was like a finger print, distinguishing one necromancer from the next.</p>
    <p>Elsie graced me with a stone face, still with a touch of emotionless grace. She didn’t even react to Carl moving or me calling her angel. Maybe I had read her wrong. Looking her over, she had the stance of someone who had been trained in etiquette. Poised, emotionless, and the manners gave her background away. I looked at her mentor, he didn’t seem like the one who would have taught her such things. Maybe her parents before she moved here.</p>
    <p>“You may call me Elsie.” She said evenly. </p>
    <p>I nodded my head, satisfied with just a first name. Names were powerful, and all she gave me was enough to recognize her magic by. Nothing more, nothing less. I was impressed. I nodded towards her mentor, Carl had been thorough with his teaching. Many mentors had to step in to stop their apprentices from spilling everything about themselves.   </p>
    <p>I was surprised, though, as she stared slightly to my left. Looking around me, I checked to make sure that she hadn’t accidentally pulled in another spirit. Though if she had, her mentor would have stopped the spell. The symbols on the ground are only powerful enough to retain one spirit. Two could cause a backlash of protective energies. When this happened, authorities write it off as a gas explosion. </p>
    <p>Moving a bit, I watched her eyes. They stayed riveted to the left of me. Well this was interesting. I had never heard of a necromancer that was blind.  </p>
    <p>Coming to the edge of the circle, I asked, “Elsie, can you see me?” </p>
    <p>Something flashed across her face. Anger? Sadness? Contempt? Reaching behind her, she pulled a notebook in front of her. Flicking it open, she asked. “I have questions pertaining to the late Marcie Prouder, what is your starting price?”</p>
    <p>It seemed that I had hit a soft spot; she wasn’t going to give up such information, so I left it at that. Listing off the possible things I would want in return for the information, I studied her. I kept studying her throughout the years. Watching her grow, learning to wish for the world of the living once again. The memories of my betrayal were still fresh in my mind, and I thought of ‘if only’s.   </p>
    <p>If only I could forget everything but her.</p>
    <p>It didn’t take long for Elsie to finish the preparations, or at least it didn’t feel like that to me. She summoned me back, her workshop still as meticulous as I had left it. Three circles surrounded the selected parties, precise, painted black ruins decorated the outside of the circles. </p>
    <p>Elsie thrummed with power, I couldn’t tear my eyes from her. Her staff hung from her hands parallel to the floor, the beads and tassels clinking together as power gathered in the focus. An old leather book floated in front of her, pages pinned as her eyes scanned the page over and over, her mind racing as she went over the details in her head. </p>
    <p>“I’m here,” I said quietly. </p>
    <p>“Then let’s get started,” She said. </p>
    <p>Syllables that I didn’t recognize spilled from her lips. They were musical as her voice rose and fell, I was entranced. Magic made itself known, lifting her hair, driving the wind, and flooding all those in the room with a sense of awe. My eyes flitted and danced, trying to catch everything all at once.</p>
    <p>Then the pain started. </p>
    <p>My eyes blinked open. There was white everywhere, or at least what made up my field of vision. It was a little disconcerting to only see white, and not any color.</p>
    <p>I didn’t recognize anything. Nothing. </p>
    <p>I didn’t even recognize myself. </p>
    <p>Was I waking up from a dream? </p>
    <p>Going into a dream?</p>
    <p>My eyes flicked to the left, picking up movement. An angel stood before me, though she looked rather gaunt and heavy clothes tried to hide her beauty. Were all angels this skinny and modest? </p>
    <p>A small smile graced her lips, and I wondered if I had glimpsed heaven. </p>
    <p>“How are you Jacob? Ready to answer my questions?” She asked softly. </p>
    <p>I turned my head looking for this Jacob, slightly jealous that she was smiling at him and not me. I wanted an angel to smile at me. </p>
    <p>A hand crossed my vision, cradling my cheek. She moved my attention back to her. She looked worried, and slightly angry. “We had a deal Jacob. I would give you a vessel and you would answer my questions.”</p>
    <p>Am I Jacob? It would make sense. “What deal?” </p>
    <p>She cursed, warping her angelic self. She sighed, leaning back onto her heels, “Knew it went too smoothly.” A notebook appeared in her hands and she began to scribble. “Can you leave that body?”</p>
    <p>I tilted my head in confusion. Leave my body? How does one leave a body? Is it a physical thing, or is it mentally driven? Squinting my eyes, I tried to force myself out of the body, but nothing happened. </p>
    <p>Sighing in defeat, I said, “No. No I can’t leave my body.” My self-worth started to deflate, the angel was not pleased with me. </p>
    <p>The angel sighed, and turned to leave. Her heels clicked as she started to glide towards the door. </p>
    <p>I sat up, reaching out. “Wait! What will happen to me?” Fear bubbled up. I didn’t know anything, I was vulnerable and new. I needed guidance. My eyes flicked to my hands, and I gasped. </p>
    <p>My body was made of cloth, it wasn’t as smooth as the angels. She had perfect, gaunt skin. Was this why she was disappointed? Was I a failed creation? Sadness washed over me, threatening to sweep me away. </p>
    <p>I heard a sigh, the angel turned her head. “I guess I’ll have to find something for you to do.” The pen tapped against her lip, “You can maintain the house until I can figure out how to reverse this.” She waved at me to follow her. </p>
    <p>The sadness and fear halted within me. I had a purpose, and the angel wasn’t going to leave me. Scrambling down, my cloth status forgotten. “What is your name angel?”</p>
    <p>A sad expression shadowed her features before disappearing. “You never change do you?” She crouched down and ruffled my yarn hair. “You may call me Elsie.”</p>
    <p>Happiness brimmed as I felt hope well within me. I had found my home. </p>
